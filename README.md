# Qcamp 2018

## Pedagogical Implementation of 'Q'KD

This repo consists of programs, missions, and handouts for Qcamp 2018 experimental session.
http://qcamp.quantumlah.org/

In short, this session consists of gamified do-it-yourself experiments, designed to convey the ideas and steps of a Quantum Key Distribution implementation and also include a remark about potential security issues. Note also that this is not a QKD implementation, even though they share a lot of properties and similarities.

For more information, you can email the organisers (mathias.seidler@u.nus.edu and anuutama@gmail.com).
