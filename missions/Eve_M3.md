**_Bob 2 (Eve)_**
## Mission 3 : Cracking the secure messages
*50 minutes of gameplay [70/200 points]*

Now, Charlie and Eve are officially a team. Both of you sign a memorandum of understanding (with Ethereum, of course) that you will work together and contrive to spy on Alice's messages. You heard from your informant that there will be a big "secret message" sending event soon. You want to obtain that message, and hopefully "blackmail" Alice and Bob. Huahahahahaha.... Good luck!
**In this mission, you will work closely with Charlie to crack the secure messages that is sent by Alice to Bob**

This mission is divided into smaller tasks, which consists of compulsory and optional tasks. The compulsory tasks are marked with either [Checkpoint], [Final Task], or [Secret Task] flags, while the unmarked tasks are sort of optional. It is thus a priority to complete all the flagged tasks before the optional tasks, as one will not be able to revisit these tasks after the deadline. The compulsory tasks are very important for the upcoming missions. It is also highly advisable to split the tasks among your teammates.
