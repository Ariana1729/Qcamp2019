## Mission 1 : Establishing Classical Communication
*90 minutes of gameplay [80/200 points]*

As a new company in innovative telecommunication industry, you want to set up a communication link to your sister company, Bob. The link utilises the (old-fashioned) IR signals, similar to how the TV remote control works.

You represent common crowd, and Bob represents big companies. In the end, the link will be used to send sensitive information (i.e. credit card details) from Alice to Bob. Thus, the goal of this mission is to establish the communication link between Alice and Bob.

The mission is further divided into smaller parts, which consists of compulsory and optional parts. The compulsory parts are marked with either [Checkpoint], [Final Mission], or [Secret Mission] flags, while the unmarked missions are sort of optional. It is thus a priority to complete all the flagged missions before the optional missions, as one will not be able to revisit this missions after the deadline. The compulsory missions also form an important basis for upcomming missions. It is also advisable to divide the mission and mission between your teammates.

> *This is sort of compulsory, but only to get the group going :P*

Objectives:
1. Choose a team captain,
1. Write down a short company manifesto, and
1. Take a team photo.

Point allocation scheme:
* [Full] points upon completion of the objectives.

### [20 points] [Checkpoint] Without the electronics, there is NONE
> *Resistor: I'm gonna ask you this one time, where is the circuit?*

> *Transistor: Yeah, I'll do you one better, WHO is the circuit?*

> *Diode: I'll do YOU one better, WHY is the circuit?*

> *- 1 divided by 0*

Objective: Construct a circuit capable of sending IR signals to Bob (while at the same time Bob needs to construct another circuit capable of receiving the IR signals). The objective is accomplished when Alice successfully sends (and Bob successfully receives) the blinking signal.

Hint: You will need to refer to the technical documents.

Point allocation scheme:
* [Full] points upon correct, efficient, and stable implementation of the circuit, or
* [80%] of total points upon successful implementation of the circuit, but not necessarily correct, efficient, nor stable.

This pedagogical exercise wil dwell a little bit deeper into how information is actually sent. Most implementations deals with binaries, which is a string of 1 and 0's. Then, how can we write numbers, words, symbols, or even emojis in this binary string?

Objective: Alice writes the message "Hello Qcamp!" in binary representation, and sent it to Bob. You will need to use the program XXX111 to perform this task. To get full points, both Alice and Bob must participate in this exercise.

Point allocation scheme:
* [Full] points when both Alice and Bob successfully completed the mission, or
* [50%] of total points, if Alice takes part and completes her mission only (without Bob).

### [10 points] Asymmetrical cryptography handout
> *When cryptography is outlawed, bayl bhgynjf jvyy unir cevinpl.*

> *-  John Perry Barlow*

Objective: Complete the "asymmetrical cryptography handout". No cheating or copying with Bob allowed [insert stern warning].

Point allocation scheme:
* Based on the number of correct responses in the handout.

### [20 points] [Final Mission] Let's chat with Bob
> *The Internet: transforming society and shaping the future through chat.*

> *- Dave Barry*

Objective: x
Hint: x

Point allocation scheme:
* x
