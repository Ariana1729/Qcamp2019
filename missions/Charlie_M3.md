**_Alice 2 (Charlie)_**
## Mission 3 : Cracking the secure messages
*50 minutes of gameplay [70/200 points]*

**In this mission, you will work closely with Eve to crack the secure messages that is sent by Alice to Bob**

This mission is divided into smaller tasks, which consists of compulsory and optional tasks. The compulsory tasks are marked with either [Checkpoint], [Final Task], or [Secret Task] flags, while the unmarked tasks are sort of optional. It is thus a priority to complete all the flagged tasks before the optional tasks, as one will not be able to revisit these tasks after the deadline. The compulsory tasks are very important for the upcoming missions. It is also highly advisable to split the tasks among your teammates.
