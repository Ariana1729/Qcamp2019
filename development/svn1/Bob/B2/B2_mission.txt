Mission 2: Receives "Hello Qcamp!" from the sender

In this mission, we want to receive the message "Hello Qcamp!" from the sender. Thus, we keep the IR receiver in listening mode, using the commonly used NEC IR protocol. The message string is encoded in ASCII format, which was sent with packets of binary pulses. Each packet of data represent each ASCII character.

Objectives: 
1. Receives the message STX + 'Hello Qcamp!' + ETX from the sender successfully (to be completed with the A team)
